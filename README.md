# 👨‍💻 Hey, I'm Larson Twum!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Security Researcher**, **Programmer**, and **Tech Enthusiast** with a love for all things tech. I dive deep into **IoT security**, **hardware hacking**, and **software vulnerability hunting**, always on the lookout for flaws that need fixing. But that’s not all—I'm also super into **aerospace** and **robotics**. From **UAVs** to **rockets**, I’m passionate about pushing the limits of technology.

## 🔍 What I Do

- **Bug Hunting & Vulnerability Research**: I spend my time hunting down security flaws in **IoT devices**, **hardware**, and **software**. Whether it’s a firmware exploit or a sneaky software vulnerability, I’m on the case, making the digital world safer.

- **Aerospace & Aeronautics**: My latest obsession is building **UAVs** (drones) with **autonomous capabilities** using **AI/ML**. I also get my hands dirty with **rocket and plane engines**, trying to design and build systems that could one day fly high in the sky (or even beyond!).

## 🛠️ Skills
